# Option B: Research Report Proposal Guide (Modern Networking)

## Template (1–2 pages)

**1. Title & Team**: Report title, names, majors, emails  
**2. Topic & Rationale**: What you will research and why it matters (2-3 sentences)  
**3. Central Question(s) & Scope**: The specific questions you’ll answer and what is in/out of scope  
**4. Proposed Outline**: 3–5 section headings with 1-line descriptions (e.g., Background, Current Approaches, Trade-offs, Case Examples, Recommendations)  
**5. Key Sources**: 5+ credible sources you plan to use (standards, vendor docs/whitepapers, reputable blogs, academic articles); include links if possible  
**6. Expected Takeaways**: What readers will learn (comparisons, trade-offs, best practices, decision criteria)  
**7. Success Criteria**: Clear scope, accurate synthesis, quality citations, coherent structure, actionable insights, professional writing

## Suggested Topics (Choose One)

- Cloud networking: VPC design patterns, load balancers (ALB/NLB), private connectivity (Direct Connect/ExpressRoute)
- Kubernetes networking: CNI models, service mesh (Istio/Linkerd), Ingress vs Gateway API
- Zero Trust networking & SASE in enterprises
- Firewalls evolution: NGFW vs WAF vs API gateways (roles and trade-offs)
- Remote access: VPN vs ZTNA and when to choose each
- DDoS mitigation: Anycast, scrubbing centers, layered defenses
- Modern DNS: DoH/DoT, resolver behavior, caching strategies, split-horizon DNS
- TLS 1.3 and QUIC/HTTP/3: impacts on latency, middleboxes, observability
- BGP security: RPKI, route leaks, MANRS, operational best practices
- CDN architectures & edge computing strategies
- Observability in networks: eBPF, NetFlow vs sFlow, tracing basics
- Wi‑Fi 6/6E/7: capabilities, spectrum, real-world trade-offs
- Data center fabrics: EVPN/VXLAN and leaf-spine designs
- Network automation & IaC: Terraform/Ansible for networking, drift detection
- AI/ML in network operations: anomaly detection and traffic forecasting

## Evaluation (Report)

Major weighting on:
- **Readability:** Clear writing and flow; concise, precise explanations
- **Organization of Sections:** Logical structure with well-titled sections and smooth transitions
- **Quality of Findings/Learnings:** Depth of synthesis, balanced perspectives, practical insights

Also considered: source quality and proper citations, relevance, and presentation clarity.

## Tips (Research Reports)

- Define a tight scope and 2–3 specific questions to answer
- Use recent, credible sources (last 3–5 years) and cite consistently
- Compare vendor/technology trade-offs with concrete examples
- Favor clarity over breadth; organize with clear section headings
- End with actionable recommendations or decision criteria
