## Network Devices in Practice

### What we'll cover
- NIC, Hub, Switch, Router, Bridge
- Wi‑Fi gear: Wi‑Fi router, WAP, RAP
- Where each device sits in a simple home/office network and what it does

## NIC (Network Interface Card)
 - Lets a device join a network and reach the Internet.
 - The device’s network port with a unique MAC identity that sends and receives traffic.
 - Serves one device, whereas switches/routers connect many devices or networks.
 - Available as wired Ethernet or Wi‑Fi; many devices (e.g., laptops) have both.
 - To keep its IP from changing, pin the IP in your router settings or use a static IP.


## Hub vs Switch

### Hub (old/repeater)
- Sends every message to all ports, so everyone shares bandwidth and can collide.
- Exists from early networks for simplicity; replaced by switches that send only where needed.
- Avoid in modern setups; use only for quick tests or legacy gear.

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[PC A] --- H[Hub]
  B[PC B] --- H
  C[PC C] --- H
  H --- D[PC D]
  A -- copied to everyone --> H
```

In the above diagram, the hub acts as a simple repeater, broadcasting every frame to ALL connected ports. When PC A sends data, PCs B, C, and D all receive it unnecessarily. This creates a single collision domain where all devices compete for shared bandwidth, leading to inefficient utilization and potential collisions.

### Switch (modern)
- Connects devices on the same network and sends traffic only where it needs to go.
- Learns which device is on which port by watching traffic.
- Stops collisions and shares bandwidth more fairly than a hub.
- Works at the Ethernet level and doesn't change IP addresses.
- Can separate groups with VLANs on one physical switch.
- In homes, the Ethernet ports on a Wi‑Fi router are a built‑in switch.

**Unmanaged vs Managed Switches:**
- **Unmanaged**: Plug-and-play, no configuration needed. Good for homes and simple setups.
- **Managed**: Can be configured via web interface or command line. Offers VLANs, QoS, port mirroring, and monitoring. Essential for business networks.

```mermaid
graph LR
  S((Switch))
  A[PC A] --- S --- B[PC B]
  C[PC C] --- S
  A -- directly to B --> S
```

In the above diagram, the switch learns MAC addresses and intelligently forwards frames only to the intended recipient. When PC A communicates with PC B, the switch sends the frame directly to PC B's port, not to PC C. This creates separate collision domains per port and enables full-duplex communication with dedicated bandwidth.

**Switch MAC Address Table Example:**

| Port | MAC Address | Status | Age (seconds) |
|------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| 1 | AA:BB:CC:01:02:03 | Learned | 45 |
| 2 | AA:BB:CC:01:02:04 | Learned | 12 |
| 3 | AA:BB:CC:01:02:05 | Learned | 8 |
| 4 | - | Empty | - |

This table shows how the switch automatically builds and maintains its forwarding database. When a device sends a frame, the switch records the source MAC address and associates it with the incoming port. The "Age" column tracks how recently each MAC was seen - entries are removed after a timeout period (typically 5 minutes) to handle device moves or disconnections.

## Bridge
- Like a small 2‑port switch: connects two network segments and forwards relavant traffic between them.
- Helps reduce noise between areas and extend networks.

```mermaid
graph LR
  Seg1[Segment A] --- BR[Bridge] --- Seg2[Segment B]
```

In the above diagram, the bridge selectively filters traffic between network segments, learning MAC addresses on each side. Local traffic within Segment A stays local and doesn't cross to Segment B, reducing congestion. Only inter-segment traffic gets forwarded, creating two separate collision domains while maintaining connectivity.

## Router
- Connects different networks (home LAN to the Internet, or LAN to LAN).
- Chooses where to send traffic between networks.
- Lets many devices share one public address using NAT.
- Acts as the default gateway so devices can reach other networks.
- Often provides a basic firewall and rules (e.g., port forwarding).

```mermaid
graph LR
  LAN[Home/Office Network] --- R[Router] --- Net[Internet]
```

In the above diagram, the router connects different networks, serving as a gateway between the private LAN (192.168.x.x addresses) and the public Internet. It performs NAT to allow multiple devices to share one public IP address and acts as the default gateway for all external traffic.

Common in homes: the “Wi‑Fi router” is a router + small switch + wireless access point in one box.

## Wi‑Fi: Router, WAP, RAP

### Wi‑Fi Router
- Routes your home network to the Internet and creates the Wi‑Fi network.
- Includes a small Ethernet switch for your wired devices.
- Secures Wi‑Fi with passwords and can offer a guest network.
- Usually assigns IPs (DHCP) and provides a basic firewall.
- Place centrally and elevated for better coverage; add a switch if you need more ports.

### WAP (Wireless Access Point)
- Creates or extends Wi‑Fi coverage and bridges wireless devices onto your existing network.
- Not a router; connects back to your router/switch over a wired link.

### RAP (Remote Access Point)
- A WAP for remote sites that connects back over the Internet to your main network.
- Useful for branch offices or home workers; traffic is tunneled back securely.
- Typically managed by a controller or cloud from the main site.

### Complete Network Overview
Here's how these devices work together in a typical small office network:

In the above diagram, this network shows how devices work together in a business environment. The Router/Firewall (orange) provides Internet access, security, and NAT. The Managed Switch (purple) distributes wired connections to PCs and servers. The Wireless Access Point (green) serves mobile devices via Wi-Fi (dotted lines). The Remote Site connects through a Bridge, extending the network geographically. The RAP provides centrally-managed wireless access at the remote location.

## Device Selection Guide

**When to use each device:**

| Scenario | Best Device | Why? |
|----------|-------------|------|

| Connect home network to Internet | Wi-Fi Router | All-in-one solution |
| Add Wi-Fi to existing network | WAP | Dedicated wireless performance |
| Connect remote office | RAP + VPN | Secure tunnel back to main site |
